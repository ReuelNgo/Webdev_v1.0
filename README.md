# Webdev_v1.0

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside. And I take a deep breath and I get real high. And I scream from the top of my lungs. “What’s going on?”

If you recognize the song from the sentence above, you probably know how I'm actually feeling everyday.

This folder is just to document my webdev learning process as a beginner. Most of the projects are inspired from https://nvanha.github.io/50-projects-html-css-javascript/, https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners and random figma instagram posts which i will reference below.

The languages used here are HTML, CSS and JS. I plan to pick up frameworks such as J.Query, React and HTML ones which I have not learned of yet.

DO NOT push any of these to production as they probably have numerous accessibility issues
